## What it this thing
This program prints all the famlies currently registered to nlctrl and their multicast groups.
It was a nice exercise in netling, generic netlink and generally linux and C stuff that I forgot after years working on other platforms.
The output is similiar to installing libnl-utils and running `genl-ctrl-list -d`
